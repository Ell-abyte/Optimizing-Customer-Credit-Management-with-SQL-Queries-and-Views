In this project, a comprehensive analysis of customer credit data was conducted through a series of SQL queries. 
These queries enabled detailed insights into customer behavior, transaction patterns, and credit usage, leading to effective credit management strategies.
Project Highlights:

Query Optimization: Implemented various SQL queries to extract specific customer information, including credit ratings, transaction details, and credit usage patterns.
Queries were designed to filter, group, and order data for precise analysis.

Insightful Queries: Utilized SQL queries to identify high-value information, such as customers exceeding credit limits, analyzing transaction patterns, and categorizing customers based on credit ratings and usage behaviors.

View Creation: Implemented views to streamline complex queries, enhancing database performance and simplifying future analyses.
Views were created to summarize transaction data, identify top customers, and calculate aggregate metrics.

Strategic Utilization: The generated views, including the total number of transactions per customer and the top 10 customers with the highest transaction amounts, provide a foundation for strategic decision-making.
These views can serve as dynamic, real-time metrics for monitoring customer behavior, enabling proactive credit management and personalized customer engagement strategies.

The project not only demonstrates querying techniques but also showcases the practical application of views to optimize data processing.
These views act as dynamic lenses, offering clear and actionable insights into customer credit behavior, empowering businesses to make informed decisions and enhance customer relationships.
